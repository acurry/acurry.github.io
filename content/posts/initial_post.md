# Inaugural blog post - :wave:

Hi there. This is my new dotcom site. I will try to post regularly about programming and software development

For now, my first venture is setting up a new static site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a tool built in [Go](golang.org).

Previously, [my site](andrewdcurry.com) was a static site built with [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/), a ruby-based tool. 

Follow along as I port over content to this new site, hosted on Github Pages.

:wave:
